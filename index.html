        <p class="sectionTag text-big" id="about" >About Tim's Musical Journey</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">&emsp;Tim Bergling, (8 September 1989-20 April 2018), known professionally as Avicii was a Swedish DJ, remixer, record producer, musician and songwriter.<br/>
            &emsp;At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal.<br/> &emsp; He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped international charts. The lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States.<br/>
            &emsp; In 2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP, Avīci (01). His catalog also included the singles "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero, "You Make Me", "X You", "Hey Brother", "Addicted to You", "The Days", "The Nights", "Waiting for Love", "Without You" and "Lonely Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012 and "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s.<br/>
            &emsp;Bergling retired from touring in 2016, having suffered from stress and poor mental health for several years. On 20 April 2018, he committed suicide while on holiday in Muscat, Oman.<br/> In 2019, his third and final album, Tim, was released posthumously.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Early Life</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">&emsp;Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm on 8 September 1989, the son of Klas Bergling and actress Anki Lidén. He had three siblings: David Bergling, Linda Sterner, and actor Anton Körberg.<br/> &emsp;He started mixing in his bedroom at the age of eight.
                Inspired by his brother, who was also a DJ, he began making music at the age of 16. In May 2007, Bergling signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label. He was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct deep house style.<br/>&emsp; By 2009 to 2010, Bergling was a prolific producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. His remixes during this period were "Sound of Now", "Muja", "Ryu" and "Even". Bergling explained that the name Avicii means "the lowest level of Buddhist hell" and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his Myspace page.<br/> &emsp;Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song "Seek Bromance", which reached the top 20 in several countries, including Belgium,[19] France,[20] the Netherlands,[21] United Kingdom,[22] and Sweden.[23] He also remixed Nadia Ali's classic single "Rapture" for her album Queen of Clubs Trilogy: Onyx Edition. In October 2010, Bergling signed with the European A&R team with EMI Music Publishing.</p>

                <p class="sectionTag text-big">Musical Styles</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">&emsp;Bergling's early work was deep house and progressive house, usually based on a four-chord structure, sub-bass and a simple synth melody. His debut studio album True featured a blending of music genres, including folktronica. While making the album, Bergling wanted to fuse the electronic music genre with soul, funk, blues, folk and country, as he felt that EDM had become too focused on "dirty drops".<br/>&emsp; Its first single, "Wake Me Up", is a folk music crossover, which, as noted by The Observer writer, "tapped into the market potential of mixing EDM and country, a template many artists have since recreated".<br/> &emsp;A Variety editor commented that Bergling's "distinct sound" was comprised by "soaring synths and keening melodies".<br/>&emsp;Musicians such as Kygo, Skrillex, Diplo, Gryffin, Martin Garrix and Cheat Codes have cited him as a source of inspiration</p>
